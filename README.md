# Aether

## Project Description:
When college students and young adults enter the adult world, they face many challenges, one of which is financial responsibility. Being a student in college or entering life as an adult allows individuals to spend as much as they like on items such as food, fashion, and accessories. This in turn creates bad spending habits leading to irresponsible and unchecked spending. **The purpose of this app is to help control this chaotic spending.**

**Project Stack:**
- Frontend: React Native, Expo Go
- Backend: Supabase Database

**Frontend UI Design:** [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/RBDknIkpOk0yTAVKn9heiV/Aether-Wireframe?node-id=0-1&t=QVBbwFjnrl0KaPaX-1)
